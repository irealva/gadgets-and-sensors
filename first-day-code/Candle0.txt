  LED Candle Demo v0.2b (Non-Candle Starter Version)
  by Scott Hudson, HCI Institute, CMU 1/10
  
  This program provides a demo of basic techniques (push button input and
  driving some LEDs) in the form of a simulated candle created with an RGB
  LED.  For this Starter version we just light the LEDs in a fixed pattern 
  for testing.
  
  Hardware
  This code assumes three LEDs or a combined RBG LED. Each of the LEDs should 
  be attached to a separate digital I/O pin (as indicated in the constants 
  below).  The LEDs are assumed to be connected as common cathode attached to 
  ground and should should each have a current limiting resistor (probably in 
  the 200-500 ohm range for 5v hardware). 
  
  Operation
  This simplified version of the program just lights the LEDs in a recognizable pattern
  for initial testing.
  
  Revisions
  1/10  Initial version v0.1a
  1/10  Split into 3 progressively more complete versions v0.2a 
  1/17  Change pin constats for new part pinout v0.2b
